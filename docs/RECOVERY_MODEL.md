# Recovery Model

## Operations

Active persisted operations become `interrupted` after restart, releasing
locks. Retry and cancellation are disabled until an owning service creates a
new executable attempt. Timeout-bounded locks prevent indefinite in-process
ownership.

## Agent connectivity

Authentication rejection, offline/unreachable, timeout, TLS failure, and
version incompatibility remain distinct states. Recovery actions use pairing,
credential repair/rotation, URL correction, service repair, or compatible
Agent update as appropriate.

Renderer recovery categories remain distinct for invalid Agent URL, TLS or
certificate failure, authentication rejection, unreachable/timeout, version
incompatibility, and duplicate registration. Each category exposes only safe
corrective actions; credential values and raw stacks are never recovery data.
Node registration preserves the original Agent status and stable failure code
when identity probing fails, instead of collapsing authentication, transport,
TLS, and timeout failures into a generic identity error.
Pairing completion is bounded to 15 seconds and aborts the underlying request.
Because a lost rotation response is ambiguous, timeout and transport failures
are not blindly retryable; recovery requires a fresh one-time pairing code.

Marketplace provider downloads are streamed into bounded memory with early
`Content-Length` rejection and mid-stream cancellation. ZIP extraction rejects
absolute/traversal paths, excessive entry counts or expanded sizes, and unsafe
compression ratios before reading entry bodies.

Provider-created instances persist with `installationState: "installing"` and
are excluded from normal instance listings and startup until server artifacts,
configuration, and metadata have been verified. The final Agent update changes
the state to `active`; that activation is the visibility boundary. Ordinary
failure or cancellation deletes the incomplete instance and reports cleanup
failure without exposing credentials.

On process startup, both the standalone Agent (before opening its HTTP listener)
and the desktop local-instance runtime (before registering IPC handlers) call
`recoverIncompleteInstallations()`. The shared routine stops a still-live PID
owned by an `installing` record, removes that incomplete instance, reports
per-instance failures, and is idempotent. It never removes active instances.

Instance status keeps the existing `state`/`lifecycleState` contract and adds
orthogonal `processState`, `readinessState`, and `healthState` fields. A live
process starts as `Starting/starting/unknown`; recognized server-ready output
changes it to `Running/ready/healthy`. A process still alive at the configured
startup deadline becomes `Running/timeout/degraded`, not falsely healthy.
Failures remain `Crashed`, bounded immediate restart failures become
`Crash Loop`, and intentional stops return to `Stopped/stopped/unknown`.
When a persisted active lifecycle record has no live or discoverable PID,
reconciliation clears the stale PID and reports `Unknown` with
`failureReason: "STALE_PID"`; it does not misreport an unobserved exit as an
intentional stop. A persisted `Stopping` record still repairs to `Stopped`.

Backup imports and restores validate gzip integrity, tar header checksums,
entry types and canonical paths before mutation. The current in-process tar
implementation intentionally caps compressed archives at 512 MiB, expanded
content at 512 MiB, individual entries at 256 MiB, and entry count at 100,000;
archives above those implemented limits fail with
`BACKUP_ARCHIVE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` rather than risking process exhaustion.
Backup archives are written to process-specific temporary files and renamed
only after the archive is complete and validated. Agent startup removes stale
temporary files and archives that have no committed metadata before scheduled
backup work begins. Recovery is idempotent and preserves archives that have a
matching metadata record.

## Instances

Runtime PID reconciliation detects live configured and detached processes.
Intentional stops do not auto-restart. Automatic restarts are bounded with
exponential backoff; exhaustion persists `CRASH_LOOP`. Manual lifecycle actions
cancel pending restart timers. Desktop and Agent shutdown use the shared
instance shutdown path: restart timers are cancelled, owned processes receive
an intentional graceful stop concurrently, waiting is capped at five seconds,
and a process still owned after a failed stop is force-terminated.

## Backup restore

Restore validates the archive, requires overwrite confirmation, verifies the
instance is stopped, checks free space on the snapshot and restore volumes, and
creates a full safety snapshot before mutation. Backup creation also checks the
destination volume before writing an archive. A partial restore failure restores
the safety snapshot. Rollback failure is reported separately as
`RESTORE_ROLLBACK_FAILED` and retains both cause codes.

## Shutdown

Desktop shutdown rejects new IPC requests, stops the updater, disposes Files
and SSH services, and waits for owned local instances before allowing Electron
to quit. Agent shutdown first closes its HTTP listener, stops backup scheduling,
ends existing sockets, waits for owned instances, and retains a ten-second
process-level failsafe. Both paths persist intentional stopped state and clear
owned PIDs during the normal shutdown flow.

Desktop file edits, imports, Agent downloads, and SFTP transfers write to a
unique sibling temporary path. The final destination is renamed only after the
write or stream completes; failure and cancellation remove the temporary
artifact. SFTP uploads follow the same temporary-upload and remote-rename
contract.

Desktop backup imports stat the selected regular file against the shared Agent
archive limit before reading it into memory. Backup exports write a sibling
temporary file and rename it into the user-selected destination only after the
buffer has been written successfully.
