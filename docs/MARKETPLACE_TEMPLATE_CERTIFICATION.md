# Marketplace Template Certification

Certification describes the repository contract, not live provider availability.
`Supported` means the template has an enabled automated installer contract and
deterministic repository coverage. `Experimental` requires extra user input or
has an intentionally limited startup contract. `Disabled` cannot be installed.
No current template is classified Deprecated or Unsupported.

All enabled templates still require at least one exact-candidate real-machine
installation before broad claims are made. Provider outages, changed upstream
artifacts, disk pressure, host permissions, and runtime behavior are external
validation concerns.
